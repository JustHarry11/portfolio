            <p>I have always enjoyed problem solving and trying to understand how everything works which led me to the Software Engineering bootcamp from General Assembly. Through the course and when I was studying Game Design I came across a lot of different problems which I enjoyed navigating and figuring out solutions for. This is what drew me to the course in the first place as there are a lot of similarities between the two. I believe that I work well as a part of a team and know how to best utilise my skills to help with any project. I want to work with the Front-End as that was the area where I felt the most enjoyment throughout the course.</p>
