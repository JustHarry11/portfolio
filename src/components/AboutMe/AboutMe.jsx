                    <p>Growing up, I have always had a passion for two things: Football and Gaming. With football, I try to watch it whenever I can. I am trying to get back into playing, but that is something I am looking forward to doing more. I am a Chelsea fan and going to the games is always a great experience, the night games are my favourite as it feels a bit different when you are under the lights.  
I like to game a bit in the evening to decompress, just turn my brain off and immerse myself in these amazing worlds. A game which I always come back to is World of Warcraft. It has given me the ability to meet so many people, even though I wouldn't say I am that good, but that doesn't stop me from having fun.
